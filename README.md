# Understanding the landscape of Open Life Science in India '22
The project seeks to unify all current and future intiatives for _Open Life Science_ in India. 

Success of the project will be defined through the creation of a website that will provide a one-stop portal for any student, academician or industry professional to leverage to identify potential communities, individuals or groups that alligns with their needs.

## VISION STATEMENT ##
__TLDR (Too Long Didn't Read)__ 
I wish to realize an India where research and the concepts of open science are encouraged and championed from the get-go.

This is to enable future generations of life science enthusiasts to find the right avenue of research in both academia and industry through informed decisions. I truly believe that exploring what is out there today, can help us be there and support future initiatives from younger generations more actively and competently.

__Who am I working with?__

Right now, I am working alone with help of my mentor, Anne Treasure. In the future, I will be open to joining forces with like-minded and passionate individuals who are crazy enough to believe that they can change the world.

__What am I doing?__

Past. Present. Future. I am trying to understand the Past, to define the Present. I am defining the Present to help realize what the Future could be. To understand the Past, I am working through the existing literature on research practices, open science initiatives, and existing government policies for the same. For the Present, I am talking with my professors and connections in both academia and the industry to understand why there remains a sense of mistrust between these two axes. Finally, for the Future, I am trying to visualize on paper which nature of this future would suit my fellow undergraduates and future generations.

__Who am I doing this for?__

For my peers, colleagues, professors and industry professionals, and future Nilabhas who want to know if the uncharted can be charted.
For myself, I never want to feel helpless and uncertain about my future. My education and exposure to different avenues of life require me to be a responsible student and global citizen and attempt to realize the landscape of research in my home country.
This is my vision. My dream is for a better world. Right now, I do not know how to make it, happen, but I will make sure I give my best. Your opinions and strategies to make it happen, are more than welcome.

P.S. I will make it a point to be more active here. If you wish to get updates, do share your email as a comment. : )
