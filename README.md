# Understanding the Open Life Science Landscape in India
This project seeks to unify all current and future intiatives for _Open Life Science_ in India. 

Success of this project will be defined through the curation of a website that will provide a one-stop portal for students, academics, or industry professionals to leverage identifying potential communities, individuals, or groups that align with their interests.

## VISION STATEMENT ##
__TLDR (Too Long Didn't Read)__ 
I want to realize an India where research and the concepts of open science are encouraged and championed from the get-go.

This is to enable future generations of life science enthusiasts to find the right avenue of research in both academia and industry through informed decisions. I truly believe that exploring what is out there today can help us forge better future initiatives through the younger generations more actively and competently.

__Who am I working with?__

Right now, I am working alone with help of my mentor, Mrs. Anne Treasure. In the future, I will be open to joining forces with like-minded and passionate individuals who are crazy enough to believe that they can change the world!

__Why am I doing what I'm doing?__

Past. Present. Future. I am trying to understand the *Past* to define the *Present*. I am defining the *Present* to realize what the *Future* could be. To understand the *Past*, I am working through the existing literature on research practices, open science initiatives, and existing government policies. For the *Present*, I am intergrating with my professors and connections in both academia and industry to understand why there remains a sense of mistrust between these two axes. Finally, for the *Future*, I will visualize on paper which nature of this future would suit my fellow undergraduates and future generations.

__Who am I doing this for?__

This is for my Peers. Colleagues. Professors. Industry Professionals.
And for future *Nilabhas* who want to know if the uncharted can be charted.

For myself, I never want to feel helpless and uncertain about my future. My education and exposure to different avenues of life require me to be a responsible student & global citizen and attempt to realize the landscape of research in my home country.

This is my vision. My dream for a better world. 
Right now, I do not know how to make it happen, but of course, I will ensure to I give it my best. 

Your opinions and strategies to make it happen are more than welcome.

P.S. I will make it a point to be more active here. If you wish to get updates, do share your email as a comment!
